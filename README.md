# Ecommerce Listing

This is my solved coding challenge, made by Greyball applicant Adrian Palacios.

I managed to correctly implement all the requested requirements, from server-side data fetching to SEO metadata.

Because the "My JSON Server" service only allows using a JSON with 10 objects, I added an option to use local data that can be easily modified in the src/app/api/products.ts file, on line 4. But I also used an endpoint, of course.

I appreciate the opportunity, I hope to receive your feedback soon. Greetings.
